Answer

I have tried many attempts at blogging and none of those could be turned into a website so now I decided to switch my strategy, not care and write my mind using the blog as the daily diary for the new information I gain everyday now that I have time and no looming sword of exams or college.
One simple goal of this blog is to write my mind, my thoughts, my opinions and the way I see things and the beauty in the world. I expect no reception, maybe this will be dust but will serve as my log of the way I( think and saw things and if that changed over the time. 
I want to host it out in the world to take a stand for the way of my thoughts and expression of those ideas to others. Keeping everything in my head is getting cramped up and putting it out makes it accessible for me to show and maybe make use of this information later. In anyway, it will help me articulate my thoughts, express myself openly and maybe make something useful out of all this, hopefully.

Usually people starting out a project have a philosophy to go by while creating it and that defines the values and principles of the project.
Well I am starting out and it's all messy so I will add to this charter as I go by (if I go by) and fill it up later.
Charter.


There are so many ideas and thoughts and just so much to learn, a whole world to see which I haven't ever before.

There are some things I would like to take inspiration from and that is the web and as I have been recently reading about weaving the web by Tim-Burnes-Lee and amazon's spider in the web. I would like to thing of me being the alien spider in the web (all of it going back to my first superhero icon - spiderman) who's trying to unreveal the patterns in the web (another reference to Feynmans' nature threads quote). I want to pass and ponder at every moment and think about the things the way they are and why they are and how they are, basically an investigation into the nature of the object of study much like how the ancient philosopher's would do, really giving a view from what goes inside the head of a person trying to understanding for the first time and connecting the existing ideas and drawing a new picture of the newly found information.

OK enough about that, I need to account myself in the start and shoot higher and higher becuase either you evolve or you die.
What's a good word length for a blog? (I will just google)

between 1,500 - 2,500 words - that was the answer of the search but what does 1.5k words look like, I know, let's use a tool to find that.

Woah that's a lot of words in 1.5K, maybe I will start lower then 500 seems good.

So decided 500 words mark everyday? Maybe 3 days a week atleast.

On any topic or predecided? leaving this to chance.

Need organization then? how about lists then lists of lists and hierarchy. seems fine

What will I need? Start simple, Just text editor in any form and a vocabulary, grammar checker might be helpful but not necessary at first.

So decided? Wait? I post it anyway right? NO matter how bad it looks? Maybe but I do save it as drafts somewhere, always.

Anything else? Nah that will be it.

So it does look like old typerwriter vibe now. Cool.

That's the end of it. For now but let's get started.
And what better than the piece of web I found that sparked this very creative joy in me and made me bold enough to choose a design so ancient by web standard that it's literally the bare bones.

First introductions to the [Motherfucking Website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) and why it matters to me. (i dont care if it does to you or not, I am gonna write about it anyway, wanna cry about it? then do)
